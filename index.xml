      <description>originally posted 2013
Nearly all computer systems now a days have hardware which have multi core chips and shared memory. in this post I hope to summarize things i learnt from a x86-TSO paper, and hope to provide a high level overview of TSO (total store order) model which is most common on x86 processors. What i really like about this paper is it provices a simple abstract model software developers can use to reason about low-level concurrency code running on x86 modern multi-core shared memory systems.</description>
